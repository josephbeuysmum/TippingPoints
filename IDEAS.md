# Tipping Points - IDEAS


## Mechanics
This is obviously open to quite a wide possiblity of areas that can affect the mechanics. Going by whats happening at the moment with COVID-19 there seems to me to be 3 key areas

1. The population as a whole, how they move around, react to panic buying, goverment advice, social media "myths"
2. The governments, how they manage their medical institutions, key workers, food distribution
3. The virus, how it spreads, either airborne, contact, water supply, etc

Each of those 3 key areas would then have the sub mechanics to drive an overall algorithm 


## Visualtion
I've always loved Civilization, wonder if the mechanics could be controlled in that "map" style
